# Wheelie
An implementation of the Pure Pursuit algorithm initially written for FIRST Tech Challenge (hence why it's written in Java).

Work is planned to be done once this is finished to create a version of this library in C for perfomance and easier interoperability with other languages.

## Goals
- Be self-contained. If an external library isn't needed, it isn't used.
- Be featureful. You should get all you need to competently use the software.
- Be documented. Open Source shouldn't be a black box. Document to the point of overkill.

## Thanks To
- Team 21734 (Till the Wheels Fall Off), for being my FTC team.
- Team 11528 (Bots of Prey), for helping found Team 21734.
- Team 23423 (Fire on the Mountain), for introducing me to Pure Pursuit.
